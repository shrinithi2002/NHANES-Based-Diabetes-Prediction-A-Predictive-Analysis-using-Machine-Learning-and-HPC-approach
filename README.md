# NHANES-Based-Diabetes-Prediction-A-Predictive-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-and-HPC-approach
This project leverages NHANES dataset, which provides extensive health and nutrition data for individuals in the U.S. The analysis focuses on predicting diabetes, where comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis were performed, followed by the application and evaluation of multiple machine learning models, including HPC with PySpark.

DATA DESCRIPTION AND RESEARCH QUESTION 

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a comprehensive program aimed at evaluating the health and nutritional status of individuals across the United States. NHANES has developed into an ongoing survey combining interviews and physical examinations of approximately 5,000 individuals annually. These participants undergo thorough assessments conducted by skilled medical professionals, encompassing medical, dental, and physiological measurements, alongside laboratory tests (Nhanes, 2023).
The research question is : How do demographic characteristics, health measures, and eating habits interrelate in influencing diabetes rates? Through analyzing these diverse factors,  can we identify meaningful patterns that could help us detect diabetes more effectively?
